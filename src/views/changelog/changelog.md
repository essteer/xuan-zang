<h1>CHANGELOG&nbsp;<span class="chinese-heading">變更日志</span></h1>

This is a log to track significant changes in the <a href="/about#design" class="internal-url">design</a> or implementation of <a href="/" class="internal-url">sinophonia.com</a>, and additions or revisions to the written content.

The full <a href="https://github.com/essteer/sinophonia" class="external-url">commit history</a> is on the site repository.

## October 2024

- Migrated the site domain from `https://www.xuan-zang.com` to `https://sinophonia.com`. Set the former domain to redirect until its expiry in 2025.

- Backend design: made long overdue updates to break site pages into HTML component subpages, then render the components using Embedded JavaScript templates and a short JavaScript method for recursive directory traversal. The code and text are now logically separated and much more manageable.

- Frontend design: made the navbar static to prevent it crowding body text; removed the footer; added blue highlights with dotted underline for internal links, solid underline for external links, and Chinese title marks; restructured text and image alignment on the Sources page; added a footnote design; replaced the Bootstrap framework entirely with custom CSS; and removed Favicon icons in favour of unicode symbols.

- Updated the URLs for the Ink and Voice sections to <a href="/ink" class="internal-url">`/ink`</a> and <a href="/voice" class="internal-url">`/voice`</a>, respectively. I had moved these to `/works/ink` and `/works/voice` in September in an attempt to introduce more structure to the URL paths, but decided I prefer the shorter URLs.

- Updated the Index and About pages to reflect the site domain migration, and expanded on site introduction and design details in the About page.

- Added entries to the Ink page for <a href="/ink#CCC" class="internal-url">Creative Comic Collection</a>, <a href="/ink#LiaoWen-hao" class="internal-url">Liao Wen-hao</a> and <a href="/ink#PaiHsien-yung" class="internal-url">Pai Hsien-yung</a>.

- Added this changelog.

## April 2023

- Site launched at `https://www.xuan-zang.com`.
